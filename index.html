            <p>This website also highlights the importance of accessibility and how easy it can be to achieve minimum accessible standards.</p>

            <h3>What is an accessible website?</h3>
                <p>Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people should be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and</li>
                    <li>contribute to the Web</li>
                </ul> 
            </section>
        
            <section>
                <h3>Why make accessible websites?</h3>
                <p>Everyone deserves equal access to the Web. In a world where almost everything is done digitally, making websites accessible means that everyone, regardless of disability, is able to navigate the Web with minimal to no assistance from other humans. Making a website accessible will also make it accessible for alternate forms of navigation such as tab navigation, keyboard navigation, and screen reader navigation, and not just the traditional mouse/track pad navigation.</p>

                <h3>How do you make a website accessible?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sufficient contrast between text color and background.</li>
                    <li>Descriptive Alt-Text of images and graphics, especially those that are important to the content.</li>
                    <li>Include HTML Structures like headings, sections, etc.</li>
                    <li>Have descriptive buttons. This means that the text of the button makes sense, not just contextual sense.</li>
                    <li>Make sure all form data is descriptive and has labels.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Provide Options</h4>
                <p>There are a lot of different visual disabilities, not all of which we can provide access for via the methods above.</p>
                <p>For those that need larger text, more contrast, or less contrast, these features can easily be built into the website through a collection of buttons. To provide even more customizable options, websites like Accessibly App provide a widget that can be added to the website, providing a lot more options for accessibility like dyslexic friendly fonts, and reading masks that make the website easier to use for all.</p>
